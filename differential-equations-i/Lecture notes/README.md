# Lecture notes
All lecture notes were written by me, and are based on the class Differential Equations I held at the Technical University Berlin. The notes are categorised after weeks. They are free to use, can freely be modified and shared. Credit to the author (Viet Duc Nguyen) is optional.

However, I assume no liability for mistakes.
