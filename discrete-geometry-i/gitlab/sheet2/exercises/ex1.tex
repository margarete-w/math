In this exercise we examine the assumptions of some theorem that we saw in the lectures.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[a)] Let $n\in \N$. Prove that there exists a finite family of convex sets $A_{1},\dots, A_{m}\subset\R^n$, $m\geq n$, such that any intersection of $n$ distinct $A_{i}~'s$ is non-empty while $\cap_{i=1}^{m}A_{i}=\emptyset$ holds.

\item[b)] Give an example of a countably infinite familiy of convex sets $\{A_{i}\}$ in some $\R^{d}, d>2,$ such that every $d+1$ of the $A_{i}$ share a common point while $\cap_{i\in\N}A_{i}=\emptyset$ holds. 

\end{enumerate}
