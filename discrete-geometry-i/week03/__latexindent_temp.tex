\section*{Exercise 01}
Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two polyhedron in $\mathbb R^n$. Consider the operator $+: \mathbb R^{n \times n} \to \mathbb R^n, (x,y) \mapsto x+y$. That operator is linear.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P_1 \times P_2$ is a polyhedron. To see this, let $A_1 x \leq b_1$ and $A_2 x \leq b_2$ denote the linear inequalities that define $P_1$ and $P_2$. Then, 
    $$
        P_1 \times P_2 = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb R^{n \times n} : A_1 x \leq b_1 \land A_2 y \leq b_2 \},
    $$
    which shows that $P_1 \times P_2$ is a polyhedron.
    \item $P_1 + P_2$ is the image of $P_1 \times P_2$ under the operator $+$. For applying a linear transformation on a polyhedra in $\mathbb R^n$ yields again a polyhedra, $P_1 + P_2$ is a polyhedra.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Exercise 02}

First, we show that $T(P)$ solves the linear inequalities. Second, we show that the linear inequalities are contained in the image of $P$ under the linear transformation $T$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $Q = T(P)$ and $y \in Q$. Then there exists $x \in P$ such that $T(x) = y$, which implies 

    $$
        \langle c_i, y \rangle = \langle c_i, T(x) \rangle = \langle T^*(c_i), x \rangle = \langle a_i, x\rangle \leq b_i \quad \forall i = 1,...,m.
    $$

    \item Let $y \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $\langle c_i,y\rangle \leq b_i$ for all $i = 1,...,m$. Then, there is $x \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $T(x) = y$ since $T$ is bijective. We show that $x \in P$, and hence it follows that $y \in T(P)$. We claim $\langle a_i, x\rangle \leq b_i$ for all $i = 1,...,m$.

    $$
        \langle c_i, y \rangle = \langle c_i, T(x) \rangle = \langle T^*(c_i), x \rangle = \langle a_i, x\rangle \leq b_i \quad \forall i = 1,...,m.
    $$
\end{enumerate}




\section*{Exercise 03}
Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Let $A$ be convex and open. Then, $A$ is algebraically open.} Let $L = \{ r + \tau s : \tau \in \mathbb{R}\}$ for any $r,s \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We want to show that 
    $$
        A \cap L = \{ r + \tau s : \tau \in I \},
    $$
    where $I$ must be an open interval.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $I$ is an interval, because $L$ and $A$ are convex and the intersection of convex sets yields a convex set. Hence, 
        $$
            A \cap L = \{ r + \tau s : \tau \in I \}
        $$
        must be convex. This set is convex if and only if $I$ is convex. Consequently, $I$ must be an intervall for the only convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^1$ are intervals.        

        \item Claim: $I$ is open. Let $x = r + \tau_0 s  \in A \cap L$ for some $\tau_0 \in \mathbb R$. To show that $I$ is open, we need to find an open neighborhood $\tau_0 \in U_\epsilon(\tau_0)$ with radius $\epsilon$ such that $r+\tau s \in A \cap L$ for all $\tau \in U_\epsilon(\tau_0)$.
        
        There exists an open neighborhood $U_{\delta}(x) \subset A$ with radius $\delta > 0$ since $A$ is open. Let $\epsilon = \frac{\delta}{||s||}$. Then, it holds for all $|\tau| < \epsilon$ that
        $$
            || x - \left(r + (\tau_0 + \tau) s\right)|| = ||\tau s|| < ||\frac{s}{||s||}\delta|| = \delta.
        $$
        This implies that 
        $$
            r + (\tau_0 + \tau) s \in U_\delta(x) \subset A \cap L.
        $$
        We found a neighborhood with the desired properties, and thus $I$ is open.
    \end{enumerate}

    We see that $I$ is an open interval. Hence, $A$ is algebraically open.

    \item \textbf{Let $A$ be algebraically open. Then, $A$ is convex and open.} By definition, $A$ is convex if $A$ is algebraically open. So, $A$ is convex. It remains to show that $A$ is open.
    
    Remember that $A$ is a subset in $\mathbb R^d$. Let $e_i$ denote the $i$-th unit vector for $i=1,...,d$. Let $x \in A$. We want to find an open neighborhood $U_\delta(x) \subset A$.

    Consider straight lines 
    $$
        L_i = \{ x  + \tau e_i : \tau \in \mathbb{R} \}, \quad i = 1,..., d,
    $$
    that when intersected with $A$ yields 
    $$
        A \cap L_i = \left\{ x + \tau e_i : \tau \in I_i \right\},
    $$
    where $I_i = (\alpha,\beta)$ is an open interval with $\alpha \in [-\infty, 0)$ and $\beta \in (0, \infty]$. Let $p_i^+ = x + \tau e_i$ with $\tau \in (\alpha,0)$ and $p_i^- = x + \tau e_i$ with $\tau \in (0, \beta)$. Then, consider the convex set 
    $$
        \mathrm{conv}\left(
            \bigcup_{i=1}^d \left\{ p_i^+, p_i^- \right\}
        \right).
    $$
    From the lecture we know that the interior of a convex set is convex. So, 
    \begin{align}\label{sponge}
        \mathrm{int}\left( \mathrm{conv}\left(
        \bigcup_{i=1}^d \left\{ p_i^+, p_i^- \right\}
    \right)\right)
    \end{align}
    is convex, too. That set is non-empty (the interior is non-empty, see exercise 5) and open. Furthermore, $A$ contains \eqref{sponge} since $A$ is convex. Thus, $\eqref{sponge}$ is an open neighborhood in $A$ containing $x$. We showed that $A$ is open.

\section*{Exercise 05}
Let $\Delta \subset\mathbb R^n$ be a simplex. Let $a_1,...,a_{n+1}$ the affinely independent points that define the simplex. Without loss of generality, we can assume that one of the vertices is the origin, i.e. $a_{n+1} = 0 \in \mathbb R^n$. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We know from linear algebra that there exists a bijective linear transformation $T$ which transforms the simplex $\Delta$ to an unit cube $Q \subset \mathbb R^d$.
    \item The point $y = \sum^n_{i=1}\frac{1}{n}e_i$ lies in the unit cube.
    \item There is an open ball $U_1(y) \subset Q$ with radius $1$ which contains $y$.
    \item $T$ and $T^{-1}$ are continous because they are bounded (known from functional analysis). Hence, $T^{-1}(U_1(y))$ is an open subset of the interior of $\Delta$, which shows that $\mathrm{int}(\Delta)\neq \emptyset$.
