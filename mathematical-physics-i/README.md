# Mathematical Physics I
Exercises and materials for the lecture Mathematical Physics I at Technical University Berlin. Held by Professor Suris in the winter semester 2018/2019.

The lecture Mathematical Physics I: Dynamical Systems and Classical Mechanics is a course offered by the Berlin Mathematical School. Inofficial lecture notes can be found [in this folder](https://github.com/geniegeist/Mathematical-Physics-I/tree/master/Lecture%20notes). It may be incomplete and may include mistakes. Let me know if you find something worth to be corrected.
